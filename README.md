# Mini_Golf-game
Hello, This is Kareem Taher. I am working on a simple yet complicated physics mini_golf game. I already took AP physics and I wanted to apply what I learned (in Mechanics) to coding!
Here are some of the functions that can be used when creating a Formulas object:
1. calc_velocity() funciton does not require parameters but it returns a double number, which is the velocity of the ball.
2. calc_time(double current_position_x) function requires a parameter of the current position of the ball, and it returns a double number indicating the time it takes the ball to reach that position in seconds.
3.calc_new_position_y() function requires the a double paramter of the current position of the ball, and it returns a double number indicating the new position of the ball in terms of y.
